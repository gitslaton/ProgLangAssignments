;; Programming Languages, Assignment 10
;;
;; In this assignment we will build an interpreter in Racket. This will be a bit different from what we did
;; in OCAML:
;;
;; - There will be no parser step
;; - The language constructs are defined via structs
;; - Expressions in the source language are valid Racket expressions, written by directly using the structs.
;; - Desugaring can be thought of as Racket functions or macros that produce source language expressions.
;;
;; Most functions are provided default mock implementations. You will need to
;; correct them.
;;
;; Unlike previous assignment, you should feel free to search through the
;; Racket documentation if you need a specific function we have not seen
;; yet. But don't overdo it, there aren't many functions you need.
;;
;;
;; The things you need to implement have the word TODO in front of them.

;; An environment will be a list of "binding" structs
;; We start with an empty environment
(define empty null)

;; TODO: Implement the function bind, which is given a symbol and a value
;; and an environment and it returns a new environment where a new binding
;; has been added to the front of the list binding s to v.
;; This should be a simple consing of a binding.
;;
(define (bind s v env)
  (cons (binding s v) env))       ;   <----- Need to implement this

;;
;; TODO: Implement the function lookup, that looks for the symbol s in
;; the structs contained in the list env, and returns the corresponding 
;; value v stored in the binding.
;; It should throw an appropriate "lookup failed" error if it can't find
;; the symbol.

;;       INTERPRETATION
;; We will now implement the interpreter. You may assume that what you are
;; given is a valid-program (no "syntax errors"). You will still need to
;; throw "implementation errors" if you are for instance asked to pick the
;; `fst` of something that is not a `pair-e`. The rules for interpretation
;; are as follows:
;;
;; - `num`, and `bool` and `nul` evaluate to themselves
;; - You do not need to check for a `clos` value as it's not allowed to
;;     be part of a valid program.
;; - A `var` needs to look the symbol up in the environment that is the
;;     argument to the interpreter function
;; - A `arith` needs to perform the correct operation based on the operator
;;     to the results of recursively interpreting e1, e2. It should throw
;;     an error if the e1, e2 don't evaluate to `num`s. This case is 
;;     provided for you. Note how we return a `num`, not a Racket number.
;; - A `comp` needs to perform the correct operation based on the operator
;;     to the results of recursively interpreting e1, e2. It should throw
;;     an error if the `e1, e2 don't evaluate to `num`s. You should return
;;     a `bool`.
;; - A `if-e` needs to first evaluate the `tst`. Throw an error if that is
;;     not a bool. Otherwise evaluate the appropriate `thn` or `els` depending
;;     on the bool's value.
;; - A `eq-e` needs to evaluate the two expressions and test them for equality
;;     using `value-eq?`
;; - A `let-e` needs to evaluate `e1` in the current environment, then extend
;;     the current environment by binding the symbol s to that value, and
;;     evaluate `e2` in this extended environment.
;; - A `fun` needs to create a `clos`.
;; - A `call` needs to evaluate `e1` and `e2`. Throw an error if `e1`
;;     did not evaluate to a `clos`. If it did evaluate to a `clos`, then
;;     you must perform that function call correctly, interpreting the
;;     closure's function's body in the appropriate environment.
;;     Note that one of the components of a `fun` element is `name`. 
;;     If it is set to #f then you can ignore it. But if it is not, then
;;     it is meant to be the name that the function can use to recursively
;;     call itself, so you need to bind it to the closure before you evaluate
;;     the body.
;;     This is probably the most complicated part of the interpreter.
;; - A `isnul` needs to evaluate the expression it contains, and returns a
;;     `bool` depending on whether that expression evaluated to `nul`.
;;     Make sure you understand the crucial difference between `isnul` and `nul?`.
;; - A `pair-e` evaluates to a `pair-e` containing the results of interpreting
;;     its components `e1`, `e2`.
;; - A `fst` evaluates the expression it contains. Throw an error if that
;;     is not a `pair-e`. If it is a `pair-e` then return its first component.
;; - A `snd` does the same as `fst`, but returning the second component instead.
